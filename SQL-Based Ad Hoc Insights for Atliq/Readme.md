## SQL Techniques Used  

- **`WHERE`** – Filters data based on conditions such as **region, customer, or fiscal year**.  
- **`GROUP BY`** – Aggregates data for **categorization and analysis** (e.g., segmenting product sales by customer).  
- **`ORDER BY`** – Sorts numerical values such as **total sales and quantity sold**.  
- **`UNION`** – Combines results from **multiple queries** (e.g., finding products with **highest & lowest** manufacturing costs).  
- **`DISTINCT`** – Extracts **unique** records (e.g., identifying **exclusive customers**).  
- **`JOINS`** – Merges data from different tables (e.g., linking **customer and sales records**).  
- **`CTEs (Common Table Expressions)`** – Creates **temporary result sets** to simplify complex queries.  
- **SQL Functions (`ROUND`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `CONCAT`, etc.)** – Performs **data processing & calculations**.  
- **`DENSE_RANK()`** – Determines **top-ranked values** in each category (e.g., **ranking top-selling products per segment**).  
- **`CASE WHEN` (Switch Case)** – Categorizes data dynamically (e.g., **grouping months into quarters**).
